How to use Git.
Step 1: Install Git
First, you need to install Git on your machine. You can download Git from the official website: Git Downloads.

Step 2: Configure Git
Before using Git, it's necessary to configure your username and email address.
This will be used to identify your contributions. Open your terminal (if you're on Windows, you can use Git Bash) and run the following commands:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

Step 3: Create a Repository
A Git repository is where you'll store your code and track changes. You can create a new one or clone an existing repository.
To create a new repository, navigate to your project directory and run:

git init

Step 4: Add and Commit Changes
Add your files to the staging area using the following command:

git add filename

To add all changed files, you can use:

git add .

Now, make your first commit:

git commit -m "Descriptive message of the change"

Step 5: View Change History
You can view the change history using:

git log

This command will display a list of all commits in your repository.

Step 6: Branches
Branches allow you to work on features or bug fixes without affecting the main branch (usually called main or master).
To create a new branch and switch to it, you can use:

git branch branch_name
git checkout branch_name

Or simply combine both commands into one:

git checkout -b branch_name

Step 7: Merge Branches
When you've finished working on a branch and want to incorporate the changes into the main branch,
use the following command (make sure you're on the branch you want to merge):

git merge branch_name

Step 8: Clone an Existing Repository
If you want to contribute to an existing project, you can clone a repository. To do this, use:

git clone repository_url

Step 9: Push Changes to a Remote Repository
If you have a repository on GitHub (or another similar service), you can push your changes using:

git push origin branch_name
